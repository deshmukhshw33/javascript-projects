# Pig Game

## Description
The Pig Game is a virtual dice game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game involves two players who take turns rolling a dice to accumulate points, with the goal of reaching 100 points to win. The game incorporates user interface interactions for rolling the dice, holding the score, and resetting the game.

## Features
- **Two Players**: Player 1 and Player 2 take turns.
- **Rolling the Dice**: Generates a random number between 1 and 6.
- **Score Accumulation**: Adds the dice roll to the current score unless the roll is 1.
- **Hold**: Adds the current score to the total score and checks for a winner.
- **Reset**: Resets all scores and sets Player 1 as the starting player.

## How to Play
1. **Roll the Dice**: The current player clicks the "Roll Dice" button. If the roll is any number other than 1, it is added to the current score. If the roll is 1, the players switch turns.
2. **Hold**: The current player can click the "Hold" button to add their current score to their total score. If the total score is 100 or more, the player wins. If not, the players switch turns.
